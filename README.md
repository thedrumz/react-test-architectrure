# React clean architecture

This project is based on a personal search for a clean, testeable and scalable architecture. Triying to apply some concepts from clean architectures, like hexagonal architecture, DDD, and some good practices as TDD.

## What is about

The project is very simple, is only a finder to search for a musical bands. Why musical bands? well, because I love music... You can type the name of the band or artist in the search bar and find some info. I use an API from [musicbrainz.org](https://musicbrainz.org/) there is no need to create any account or deal with authentication, is an open API, so, you can clone the repo, install dependencies and everything will work

## What can you find here

I'm trying to apply some practices from clean architectures and patterns commonly used in back-end projects, but not often in front-end. The main goal is to decouple layers to make an easy testeable and scalable architecture, using services, repositories, mocks, test factories (or Object Mothers), etc...

## How to run

The application is based on CRA template, so, you can run it very easily cloning the repo and executing `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn start` to run it
